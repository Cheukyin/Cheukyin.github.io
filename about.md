<li><b>Arch Linux:</b> I use Linux every day. Previously I have been using Ubuntu for
many years. Now I have switched to Arch + KDE as my main desktop.

What's more, I love reading and have read a bunch of novels.<br />So much words I've read, I want to write some articles by myself.<br />Therefore, I hopes to enhance my poor writing skills here, whether Chinese or English.

#### How this Site is Developed

This website is created with Jekyll, a static website generator written in Ruby.  
The theme is inspired of Havee's site. Thanks to <a href="http://havee.me">Havee.me</a>.  
The articles are written in Org-Mode with Emacs, you can have a look at my emacs config on my <a href="https://github.com/Cheukyin/.emacs.d">Github</a>.
